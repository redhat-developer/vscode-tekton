### Setup kubernetes cluster to use with extension

To use the extension, developers can deploy Tekton Pipelines into a minikube instance or use [Red Hat CodeReady Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers).

#### Red Hat CodeReady Containers

Red Hat CodeReady Containers is a simple way to start OpenShift Cluster on your laptop in a matter of minutes, follow [this documentation](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/) to get it up and running. After cluster is started follow [this steps](https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial/#install-openshift-pipelines) to deploy OpenShift Pipelines into a OpenShift cluster.

#### minikube

For detailed analysis of how to setup Tekton Pipelines into minikube instance, please follow the [instructions/tutorial](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline#want-to-start-using-pipelines).

### Tutorial

Follow Tekton Pipeline Extension [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) inspired by [original tutorial](https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial) that uses OpenShift Developer Console, `tkn` and `oc` command line tools.

### Commands and features

Development of the Tekton Pipelines Extension is largely following development of the [`tkn` CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli) as well as [Tekton Pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) which are both under active development and potentially subject to drastic changes. Please don't hesitate to open an [issue](issues) if you find a bug or something breaks unexpectedly. Pull Requests are always welcome--see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) section for details.

`tekton-pipelines` supports a number of commands & actions for interacting with Tekton Pipelines; these are accessible via the command menu (`Cmd+Shift+P` <kbd>⌘⇧P</kbd> on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` <kbd>⌃⇧P</kbd> on Windows and Linux) and may be bound to keys in the normal way.
